Face Detection and Recognition using Haar Cascade Classifier and Linear Binary Pattern Histogram using Deep neural network.

A dataset was created with a number of different faces and then using the dataset, the deep neural network has been trained. For finding a face, Cascade Classifier was used which contains around 160000 features for identifying the face. Linear Binary Pattern Histogram [LBPH] has been used to recognize the face.
